Hello there! I am **Harun**, a **Software Developer** at [**DoÄŸuÅŸ Technology**](https://www.d-teknoloji.com.tr/), with a strong focus on **Enterprise Software and Open Source**. I earned a [Telecommunication Engineering](http://www.ehb.itu.edu.tr/) B.Sc. at [**ITU**](http://www.itu.edu.tr/).

I am also playing games, watching series, and loving to reasearch. I like to call myself a *beta tester*.
